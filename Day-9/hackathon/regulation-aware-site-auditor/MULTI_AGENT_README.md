- Regional compliance variations analysis
- Recent court cases and enforcement actions
- Emerging regulatory trends identification

**Backstory:** Legal research specialist focused on digital compliance and web accessibility law. Continuously monitors legal databases, government websites, and regulatory announcements to ensure recommendations are based on current legal requirements.

### 3. üéØ Issue Mapping Agent
**Role:** Compliance Issue Mapping Specialist  
**Goal:** Map discovered issues to specific regulations, assess severity, and prioritize violations based on legal risk

**Capabilities:**
- Technical issue to regulatory requirement mapping
- Legal risk and potential penalty assessment
- Business impact analysis

**Backstory:** Technical compliance implementation expert who provides specific code examples, implementation guides, testing strategies, and maintenance recommendations. Solutions are practical, technically sound, and designed for long-term compliance sustainability.

## üìä Multi-Agent Workflow

The agents work in **sequential coordination** using CrewAI's orchestration:

1. **Compliance Scanner** performs initial website analysis
2. **Legal Update Retriever** fetches current regulatory context
3. **Issue Mapping Agent** correlates findings with legal requirements
4. **Remediation Advisor** generates actionable implementation plans

Each agent has access to the previous agents' outputs, creating a comprehensive, context-aware analysis pipeline.
